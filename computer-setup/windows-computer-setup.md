## Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows developers to run a GNU/Linux environment, which includes command-line tools, utilities, and applications, directly on Windows without the need for a virtual machine manager or dual-boot setup.

[Video tutorial for the installation process](https://www.loom.com/share/7dab16c5803f4af5abf6dc24efd51749?sid=a100f5ef-0acd-4044-b514-bfca17ae8c3d)

### Instructions to install Windows Subsystem for Linux

1. Open Windows Terminal as an administrator (right-click on the app, select "Run as administrator"). Run the following command:

  ```powershell
    wsl --install
  ```

**NOTE: The ```wsl --install``` command should automatically start an Ubuntu session immediately - this is where you will set up your default unix user. If it doesn't follow the instructions in the terminal to start the session (should be something like `wsl.exe --install` to setup your user)**


1. The unix user will be the name of the user that you will be using in development. It does not need to match your windows user name - but should be easy to remember and recognise as you.

2. Setting the unix user password is critical as you will need it frequently in the future. Ensure its easy for *you* to remember!
    ***The password field will not show characters while typing as it is a blind-type field, please be careful while inputting your password***

  **If for any reason you forgot the password of the UNIX user you created follow the [How to reset the password for the UNIX user in WSL](https://github.com/devslopes/dwa-orientation-curriculum/blob/master/computer-setup/common-wsl-debugging.md#how-to-reset-the-password-for-the-unix-user-in-wsl)** instructions.

4. Open up a windows terminal as an admin and type in
  
  ```powershell
  wsl --status
  ```

  to check if you are on version 2, if not follow the [WSL2 invalid machine configuration troubleshooting](https://github.com/devslopes/dwa-orientation-curriculum/blob/master/computer-setup/common-wsl-debugging.md#wsl2-invalid-machine-configuration-troubleshooting) steps before continuing to step 6

7. Restart your computer to finish the installation.
   **From here on all commands should be run in the Ubuntu terminal**

8. Open the Ubuntu application (should have an orange circular icon) as an administrator. Right-click the top of your Ubuntu window and go to Properties.
   1. Make sure to click the box that says `use Ctr + Shift + C/V as Copy/Paste`
   2. This will make it easier to copy stuff over to your ubuntu terminal both now and in the future


## Install some WSL Packages

[Video tutorial for the WSL customization process](https://www.loom.com/share/b533a79f291842439d9f23b7c3805327?sid=cb4661c1-1d95-4a7d-b98a-1aa434034f84)

1. Run the following command to fetch the available software updates from index.

```bash
  sudo apt update
```

2. Run the following command to upgrade all the installed packages to their latest versions.

```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```

3. Install some useful packages using the next command. This will install some packages that you will need later on in this course.

```bash
sudo apt install zsh unzip git
```

4. Change default shell to zsh.This will make your terminal look nicer, and give you some extra useful information.

```bash
  chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

5. Restart Ubuntu by closing and re-opening the window

    - you should get a message telling you that "this is the Z Shell Configuration funtion ... " , we will set this up later so just press 0 


## Setup VSCode to Work With WSL

1.In VSCode Install WSL Plugin

Go to the extension store in VSCode and download the WSL extension. It should be produced by microsoft and have over 20M downloads

This is extremely important, and will let you use VSCode with your WSL for Linux

That's it for this one ðŸ˜ƒ

To test to see if it worked, go into your Ubuntu terminal and type in

```bash
which code
```

As long as it doesn't say `command not found "code"` or something like that, then you are good to go âœ…

## Install zgen

Run this command to clone down the files for zgen

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen.git "${HOME}/.zgen"
```

ZGen will make your terminal much nicer looking. Watch what happens after running a few commands.

To finish this installation, let's open our `zsh` configuration file by typing the following in Ubuntu

```bash
code ~/.zshrc
```

Then you will copy and paste the following contents into the `.zshrc` configuration file and hit save

```zsh
source "${HOME}/.zgen/zgen.zsh"

zgen prezto
prompt steeef

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"   # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
# This loads nvm bash_completion
```

## NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, making it particularly well-suited for applications that require real-time communication and data-intensive tasks. Node.js enables developers to write server-side code using JavaScript, which reduces the complexity of having separate client-side and server-side languages. It has a vibrant ecosystem with a wide range of libraries and frameworks, which makes it a popular choice for web and network application development.

### Instructions to install Node.js with NVM

1. Launch the Ubuntu app.
2. Install Node to install nvm please run the following command in your terminal

```bash
 curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | zsh
 ```
3. Run the following command to install the latest long term support version of Node.js.
  
   ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   ```
4. Run the following command to set up the default node alias
    ```bash
    nvm alias default node
    ```
     
#### Test your Node.js installation

1. Run the command `nvm list` to check the default version of Node.js is v22.13.0
2. Run the command `node -v` to check the current version of Node.js is v22.13.0
3. Run the command `npm -v` to check the installed version of Node Package Manager (NPM)

## GIT

GIT is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate on projects, and manage source code effectively. It provides a way to keep a history of changes made to files, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. GIT's decentralized architecture allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, independently making changes and merging them seamlessly. It also supports branching, which enables developers to work on separate features or experiments without affecting the main project, and later merge those branches back together. GIT has become an essential tool for software development, enabling teams to work collaboratively, track changes, and ensure code integrity.

GIT is already included in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), so there is no need for a separate installation. However, you may still need to configure GIT to work properly within the WSL environment and Github remote repos.

### Instructions to configure GIT

[Video tutorial for the Git & GitHub installation process](https://www.loom.com/share/6f7281ba0c374dc193e7b8aa5e2f1ae9?sid=9c651724-4c20-4b6e-92a2-b5ebb9d97436)

We've already installed Git earlier when we ran `sudo apt install xxx xxx git`. Git was one of the pieces of software that our package manager `apt` was installing.

Please verify that it is there by typing in.

`which git`

As long as it doesn't say 'Command Not Found' we're good to go

1. Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/signup).
2. Open an Ubuntu Terminal (May be easier to copy / paste inside of VSCode)
3. Run the command `git config --global user.name "John Doe"` to set the default user name. **Make sure that you change this text to match your username that you used for github.**
4. Run the command `git config --global user.email name@domain.zone` to set the default email, which should match the email used during GitHub sign-up.**Make sure that you change this text to match your email that you used for github.**

5. Run the command `git config user.name` to verify that the user name is set correctly.
6. Run the command `git config user.email` to verify that the user email is set correctly.

### Instructions to set the SSH key for GITHUB
